The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiological Research (WONDER) data retrieval system provides access to many types of public health information. Mortality and fertility counts for multiple years across standard geographical subdivisions broken down by race, gender, 5-year age groups, etc. are just some of the data available through this system.

This post describes a new method to recover some of these suppressed counts.
